        "1. **Strong course alignment:** Graph mining (centrality, PageRank, community detection) is covered in HW3–HW4; this benchmark provides standardized graphs to apply and extend those techniques.\n",
        "2. **Clear beyond-course angle:** Fairness-aware graph learning and bias measurement/mitigation in GNNs are not covered in class and offer a meaningful extension into responsible ML.\n",
        "3. **Interpretable EDA:** Degree distribution, connectivity (SCC/WCC), sensitive-attribute and label balance, and basic fairness metrics are straightforward to analyze and motivate both course and external techniques.\n",
        "4. **Portfolio-friendly:** Graph learning and fairness are highly relevant for industry (recommendation, social networks, hiring); experience with this benchmark translates well to interviews and projects.\n",
        "5. **Manageable scope:** Graphs can be loaded with NetworkX or PyTorch Geometric; Python tooling used in HW3–HW4 is sufficient for EDA and initial mining.\n",

        "- **Sensitive attributes** — require careful handling and ethical use; benchmark is designed for fairness analysis, not discrimination.\n",
        "- **Data availability** — dataset/code must be obtained from the paper or authors (e.g., GitHub, Zenodo); EDA can be designed against the expected schema (nodes, edges, features, labels, sensitive attribute) and run once data is available."
