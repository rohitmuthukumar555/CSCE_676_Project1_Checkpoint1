# CSCE 676 Data Mining Project

**For Questions A, B, C, E, F : please refer REPORT.md file**
**For Question D, please refer project1_checkpoint1.ipynb file**

## Overview

This repository contains **dataset selection**, **comparative analysis**, and **exploratory data analysis (EDA)** for a data mining course project. All three candidate datasets are from the KDD 2025 Datasets and Benchmarks track.

**Selected dataset:** Fairness-Aware Graph Learning: A Benchmark (KDD 2025) — graph data for graph mining (PageRank, community detection) and fairness-aware graph learning.

**Conference source:** [KDD 2025 Datasets and Benchmarks Track](https://kdd2025.kdd.org/datasets-and-benchmarks-track-papers-2/)

## Setup

1. **Clone the repository** (after pushing to your GitHub):

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/rohitmuthukumar555/CSCE_676_Project1_Checkpoint1
   ```
2. **Install dependencies:**

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
3. Open `project1_checkpoint1.ipynb` in Jupyter or VS Code.

4. Run all cells to perform EDA: graph basics, degree distribution, connectivity, labels and sensitive-attribute distribution, and bias considerations.
